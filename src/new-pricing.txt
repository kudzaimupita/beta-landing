## How Deployment Limits Work

### Example Scenario: Basic Plan
You're on the **Basic Plan** with a limit of 5 deployed applications:

1. **Create** unlimited draft applications in your workspace ✅
2. **Deploy** 5 applications (hitting your limit)
3. **Want to deploy a 6th app?** You have options:
   - Undeploy one of your current 5 apps, then deploy the new one
   - Upgrade to Pro Plan for 15 deployed apps
4. **Development continues:** Keep building and testing all apps locally

### Deployment Swapping
- **Quick swap:** Undeploy App A → Deploy App B (takes ~2 minutes)
- **No data loss:** Undeploying preserves all app data and configuration
- **Instant redeployment:** Previously deployed apps can be redeployed anytime
